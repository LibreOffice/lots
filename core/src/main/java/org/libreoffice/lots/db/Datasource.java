/**
 * Interface for data sources that the DJ can manage. CAUTION! The constructors of this class must not perform 
 * potentially long-blocking actions (e.g., establishing a network connection). 
 * They must not fail if any preconditions are not met, which are only relevant for
 * accessing the records (e.g., connection to the LDAP server).
 * The constructor should (and must) only fail if it's not possible to bring the data source 
 * into a state where it can execute methods that are independent of the records. 
 * Most importantly, this includes methods for querying the schema.
 * For methods that access records, their failure due to conditions (e.g., no network)
 * must not render the data source object unusable. Wherever possible,
 * it should be possible to retry an operation at a later time if the conditions have changed,
 * and the operation should succeed then. This particularly means that connection establishment to servers,
 * where necessary, should be retried as needed and not just once in the constructor.
 * In this context, it should be noted that connections should be explicitly
 * closed using close() (typically in a finally() block to ensure it's executed even in exceptional cases)
 * because Java's Garbage Collection may do this very late. <br>
 * <br> Arguments against the "override" data source type: - (correct) search implementation
 * would be difficult and inefficient - would likely result in poorer data maintenance in
 * LDAP because it's easier to introduce an override
